* List of known bugs for RTLIB 2.0

** ASSIGNED Instruction parser fails silently

   - State "ASSIGNED"   from "OPEN"       [2017-04-06 jeu. 13:45] \\
     Giuseppe Lipari
   - State "OPEN"       from              [2017-04-06 jeu. 13:44]

   For example, if the programmer forgets the final ; after and instruction, 
   the instruction object is not created

   Example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC c++
   t.addInstr("raise_thres(1);fixed(2);lower_thres(1)");
   #+END_SRC
   it will not create lower_thres


** ASSIGNED Instruction parser fails when instruction has no arguments
   - State "ASSIGNED"   from "OPEN"       [2017-04-06 jeu. 13:45] \\
     Giuseppe
   - State "OPEN"       from              [2017-04-06 jeu. 13:44]

   For example, if the programmer forgets an argument as follows

   #+BEGIN_SRC c++
   t.addInstr("raise_thres(1);fixed(2);lower_thres();");   
   #+END_SRC
   the last instruction is not created. This bug makes it impossible
   to write instructions with no parameters


** OPEN Debug does not work 

   - State "OPEN"       from              [2017-04-06 jeu. 13:44]

   When selecting SIMUL.debug("All"), it will only print metasim
   debugging information. When selecting a specific constant (like
   _SCHED_DBG_LEV) it will print nothing.

** ASSIGNED 
   - State "ASSIGNED"   from "OPEN"       [2017-04-11 mar. 17:38] \\

   - State "OPEN"       from              [2017-04-11 mar. 17:38]

   When calling getLastValue() on a statistical object at the end of a
   single simulation run, I get core dump. Need to investigate if it
   is a local problem with my setup or if it is a bug of MetaSim. 

   - Write a test for it!
