    /** 
        \ingroup tasks

        This class models a cyclic task. A cyclic task is a task that is
        cyclically activated by a timer (for example a periodic task) or
        by an external event (sporadic or aperiodic task). 
      
        This class models a "run-to-completion" semantic.  Every
        activation (also called arrival), an instance of the task is
        executed. The task executes all the instructions in the
        sequence until the last one, and then the instance is
        completed (task end). At the next activation, the task starts
        executing a new instance, and the instruction pointer is reset
        to the beginning of the sequence.

        Also:

        - when a job arrives, the corresponding deadline is set
        (the class Task has no deadline parameter).
        
        - it adds a deadline event to check deadline misses; it can
        abort the simulation in case of deadline miss (depending on
        the abort parameter in the constructor).
